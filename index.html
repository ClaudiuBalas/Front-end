                Rugby is a full-contact team sport known for its physicality and intensity. It originated in England in the early 19th century and has since evolved 
                into two primary forms: Rugby Union and Rugby League. Both versions share similarities in terms of gameplay but have distinct rules and regulations.

                    <br />
                Basic Rules of Rugby:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Rugby is typically played with two teams of 15 players each, but variations with different player numbers exist. The objective of the game is to score points by carrying, passing, and kicking the ball to the opposing team's in-goal area and grounding it, similar to American football, to score a try.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                1.Scoring: Teams can score points through tries, conversions, penalties, and drop goals.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                -Try: A try is scored by carrying the ball across the opponent's try line and touching it down, earning 5 points.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                -Conversion: After a try, the scoring team has the opportunity to kick the ball through the goalposts for 2 additional points.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                -Penalty: A successful penalty kick through the goalposts is worth 3 points.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                -Drop Goal: A drop goal is kicked during open play and is worth 3 points.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                2.Forward Pass: Passing the ball forward is not allowed. The ball must be passed backward or kicked forward.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                3.Knock-On: If a player drops the ball forward (knocks it on), it results in a scrum awarded to the opposing team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                4.Offside: Players must remain behind the back foot of the last player in a ruck or maul until the ball is played. In open play, players must stay behind the ball.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                5.Tackling: Tackles must be made below the shoulders and without dangerous play. High tackles are penalized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                6.Rucks and Mauls: These are phases of play where players contest possession. Rucks occur after a tackle, while mauls involve players on their feet binding together. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                Penalties and Violations in Rugby:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Rugby has numerous penalties and violations, and the most common include:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Offside: Players must stay behind the back foot of the last player in a ruck or maul and remain onside during open play.
                    <br />
                    <br /> 
                High Tackle: Tackles that make contact with the opponent's neck or head area are considered high tackles and are penalized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Knock-On: When a player drops the ball forward, resulting in a scrum for the opposing team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Forward Pass: Passing the ball forward is not allowed and results in a scrum.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Obstruction: Blocking or obstructing opponents is a violation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Offside at a Scrum or Lineout: Players must stay behind the offside line at these set pieces.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Dangerous Play: Any reckless or dangerous actions can result in penalties.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Foul Play: Any actions that endanger opponents or breach the laws can lead to penalties, yellow cards, or red cards, depending on the severity.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                Penalties can result in the awarding of free kicks or scrums to the opposing team, and more severe offenses may lead to players being temporarily or permanently sent off the field. The specifics of rugby rules can vary slightly between Rugby Union and Rugby League, but these are the fundamental aspects common to both versions.
